# Subwayclock

Subwayclock is a simple program used to power a Raspberry PI-based countdown
clock. The display is similar to the countdown clocks that can be seen on the
New York Subway platform.

# Requirements

In order to use this library, you'll need the following:

1. An MTA API key. You can register for an account at: http://datamine.mta.info/
2. A Raspberry PI. I have personally tested this on a Raspberry PI Zero W, but other models should work.
3. An [Inky pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat) display.

# Usage

TBD
